# C Programming Practice in short semester
This is my C Programming Practice taken in short semester in my freshman year in Computer Science Department, Xiamen University. This course was lectured by Prof. Liansheng Wang. It includes 5 projects, and each project has several tasks.

## What's in it?
There are two directories. 

- First one is `code`, which includes the source code written by C (or C++ maybe). You can use `g++` to compiler them. 
- Another one is `problems`, which includes 5 Microsoft Word documents written by Chinese. They are description of projects.

## How to use?
Because I use some C++ features, please use `g++` to compiler.

Please try to finish projects by yourself at first. You can refer to my code if and only if you really need help. **DON'T CHEAT!**
